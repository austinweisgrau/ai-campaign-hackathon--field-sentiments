    " There was a gentleman sitting on the front porch. I introduced myself, explained what we were doing, giving out lit. I asked him if this is who that was that lived there. I asked him if they were both going to vote. He just gave a thumbs up and took the piece of lit and he seemed receptive and confirmed that he would vote all nonverbally because there was really that loud music playing. But that household seemed that they knew about the election and were going to vote and.",
    " A lot of Cherry Street just now in Clarksdale, Mississippi. Just all the canvassing that I've done. Like perhaps the most established neighborhood I've been in yet with canvassing in. But it definitely kind of ran the gamut as far as responses. I give what encouragement as best I could. Very thankful and very friendly, excited to vote, said they would vote.",
    " Went to a house on Harrison Avenue in Clarksdale. You know, I gave a general review of the upcoming election in confirmed if they would all be voting. It was a little difficult getting each person to commit to vote. And also some of those people I don't think live there, but one or two of the folks were very receptive and confirmed that they would vote. Everyone seemed receptive to it. In general, those folks are receptive to receiving the information as well.",
    " Conversation with a resident on School Street in Clarksdale. Talked about how important this election was. He talked about a lot of things, one of them being prices. He also referenced that it's a lot of violence and crime in the neighborhood. But he definitely lifted up and agreed with the importance of voting. He was going to remind others to vote too, and he appreciated what we were doing and.",
    " Had a really awesome conversation with this older gentleman, Lee William, who's staying on Walnut street, couldn't reach the other folks at the house, but he was there. I was really brave and knocked a second time after he had said who was it? And he was asking who the candidates are and he asked me to look up his polling location. One word I have is that I'm not sure that he's registered because I tried to look him up, but we'll find out. But he was really resonated with this idea that Mississippi needs a change. He got very excited about that.",
    " Sweetest family just opened the door. They're both planning on voting. They said they had just been talking about it. Feel like I could have engaged them in more conversation, but they had little ones, and it seemed like they had somebody there working on an appliance or something. But they were really friendly and they were watching two little ones, maybe family members cruise. So, yeah, seemed great.",
    " You spoke with voter who was prepared, knew where the precinct was, was very receptive. Actually said she was happy that we were out doing this great contact.",
    " Resident. Not sure if it was the voter just refused to answer and did not want the lit drop either.",
    " Okay. Spoke with very enthusiastic and well informed voter. Knew who they were voting for, where the precinct was and he was enthusiastic about voting.",
    " I spoke with multiple voters. One household, three person household, parents are intending to vote. Son indicated that he is not. Two other residents answered not super responsive. Seemed to be at least willing to take the literature.",
    "Talked to the voter about the upcoming election and she said she wasn't going to vote, hasn't voted in a few years, all politicians nationally are corrupt. Said Mississippi hasn't had governor in five to ten years. Seemed very frustrated with the political system. Asked if that was the same feeling she had about local candidates and she said yes, they're all bad, nobody worth voting for. She did say she paid attention to the mayor and has voted for the mayor, but it's been also a few years, nobody worth voting for at the local level, even though it sounded like she paid a little bit more attention to that.",
    "Politics is just something she's never really paid attention to. Asked if there was issues that she thought about even if she didn't vote, and she said no. I think the phrase she used was, it's going to do? So I've just got the sense that it was this thing external to her life that she just doesn't pay much attention to and doesn't think about. That was also the case at the local level. I asked specifically about presidential governor running for mayor and she wasn't interested in politics at any level of government.",
    " I just talked to a really lovely resident here who has been here for about two years, and she appreciated the reminder about voting. She said she will definitely vote. Ultimately found out that her son usually will reach out who lives in the area and will say, hey, mom, this is who you should vote for. But, yeah, I think that's super interesting. It's just she was committed to being there on Election day and voting.",
    " I had an even shorter interaction with a woman who I gave the lit to. And I was like, do you have a plan to vote? You can call this number. No. Did not sound appreciative of being interrupted. So sorry about that.",
    " Had a really lovely interaction with someone. I knocked on their door, which had an I voted sticker on it. And she was like, oh, yeah, I know Deborah. They're actually supposed to come and give me a ride. And I did give lit to that neighbor, but she wasn't really in a state to have a conversation. So cool to know that the nonprofit is reaching folks out here already.",
    " It. I also had three families total, or people total hop in their car and didn't pull away before I could get to their house. Like as I was coming up to their house next. So I thought that was a little funny. Didn't get to speak to them, but I left the palm card under their mat.",
    " I just met a group of about, like, six kids. They're all walking in the community, and they stopped me to see what I was doing, told them I was handing out these palm cars and everything, and they took a couple from me. I think they're gonna take to their parents as soon as they're done playing and everything, and.",
    " You today while walking found a bunch of my grandfather's friends and classmates were able to have conversations with them because they've all been voting since way before I was born. Many of them said it's their duty in a sense, and I believe as a whole whole. We all need to have that same mentality when it comes to voting. It's our duty, like take it upon ourselves to do this every time with no questions asked. Once we get the communities like that, I think we'll be able to make the biggest difference within the whole United States.",
    " While canvassing today, Pastor Davis ended up stopping at one house for me on believe it was Mills Avenue. And the two guys who he ended up speaking to weren't going to go vote today. He ended up convincing them to go vote and actually gave them a ride to the polls. So that was just amazing. Pastor Davis has a lot of experience with this type of work. He knocks doors for his church and just also for other things in the community.",
